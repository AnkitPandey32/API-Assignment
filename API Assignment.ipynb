    "Let's go through each question from your Web API assignment and provide detailed answers along with appropriate examples. You can compile this into a Jupyter Notebook and then upload it to GitHub as instructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1. What is an API? Give an example where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to communicate with each other, allowing different systems to exchange information and perform functions without needing to understand each other's internal workings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-Life Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A common real-life example of an API is the Google Maps API. Many applications and websites use Google Maps to display maps, get directions, and show locations. When you use a ride-sharing app like Uber, it uses the Google Maps API to display the map, calculate routes, and estimate travel times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interoperability**: APIs allow different systems and applications to communicate and work together, enhancing interoperability.\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**: They enable developers to integrate new features into their applications quickly by using existing services.\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: APIs can handle multiple requests and are designed to work efficiently even with a large number of users.\n",
    "4. **Automation**: APIs enable the automation of repetitive tasks by allowing applications to interact without human intervention.\n",
    "5. **Innovation**: By providing access to external services and data, APIs foster innovation and the development of new applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Security Risks**: APIs can be a target for security attacks if not properly secured.\n",
    "2. **Complexity**: Integrating multiple APIs can be complex and require significant development effort.\n",
    "3. **Dependency**: Relying on third-party APIs can create dependencies on external services that may change or become unavailable.\n",
    "4. **Performance Issues**: Poorly designed APIs can lead to performance bottlenecks and slow application response times.\n",
    "5. **Versioning Issues**: Changes in API versions can break existing integrations, requiring ongoing maintenance and updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Web API** is a specific type of API that is designed to be accessed over the web using HTTP/HTTPS protocols. It allows web applications to communicate with each other and with other services over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference between API and Web API:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **API**: General term for any interface that allows applications to communicate with each other, which can be used within the same system or across different systems.\n",
    "- **Web API**: A subset of APIs that are specifically designed to be accessed over the web using HTTP/HTTPS. Web APIs are typically used for web services and applications to interact with each other over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**REST (Representational State Transfer):**\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server communication protocol, typically HTTP. RESTful APIs use HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources, which are identified by URIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Principles of REST:**\n",
    "- Stateless: Each request from a client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.\n",
    "- Uniform Interface: Resources are accessed and manipulated using a consistent interface (HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).\n",
    "- Resource Representation: Resources are represented in standard formats such as JSON or XML.\n",
    "- Scalability: RESTful APIs are designed to be scalable and can handle large numbers of requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):**\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services using XML. It relies on XML-based messaging protocols and typically uses HTTP or SMTP for message negotiation and transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shortcomings of SOAP:**\n",
    "- **Complexity**: SOAP is more complex than REST due to its strict standards and extensive XML messaging.\n",
    "- **Overhead**: SOAP messages are larger due to XML format, leading to higher bandwidth usage.\n",
    "- **Performance**: The verbosity of XML in SOAP can lead to slower performance compared to REST.\n",
    "- **Limited Browser Support**: SOAP is less compatible with web browsers, which primarily support RESTful services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Differentiate between REST and SOAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | REST | SOAP |\n",
    "|---------|------|------|\n",
    "| Protocol | Uses HTTP/HTTPS | Can use HTTP/HTTPS, SMTP, TCP |\n",
    "| Message Format | Typically JSON or XML | XML |\n",
    "| Complexity | Simple, easy to use and understand | Complex, requires strict standards |\n",
    "| Performance | Faster, lightweight | Slower due to XML verbosity |\n",
    "| Security | Relies on HTTP-based security (e.g., SSL/TLS) | Built-in security features (WS-Security) |\n",
    "| State | Stateless | Can be stateless or stateful |\n",
    "| Browser Support | Well-supported by web browsers | Limited browser support |\n",
    "| Use Cases | Best for CRUD operations and web services | Best for enterprise-level services with complex transactions |\n",
